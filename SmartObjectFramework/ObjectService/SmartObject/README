SmartObject base classes module

The base abstract class is Resource, from which the specific 
content types are derived for the various functional resources.

The SmartObject is itself a Resource that contains the other resource
types

For a description of the functional roles of the specific resource
types, see http://iot-datamodels.blogspot.com

The structure of a SmartObject is derived through semantic indirection 
or simple URI-Path mapping. Resources contained within a SmartObject
are by default available at the URL ../SmartObject/Resource which
corresponds to the Object notation SmartObject.Resource

All Resource types potentially have Create, Delete, Set, and Get 
methods for interacting with their default functional properties.
The precise semantic definition of those operations is content 
dependent and defined by overriding the default methods for each 
specific resource type. For Example, the GET method for a default 
PropertOfInterest returns the list type containing a single instance 
of a string or scalar. The GET method for a Description returns
a list of RDF triples matching an abstract description. 

These content-specific methods may be directly exposed through
URL-Path and URI-query mapping e.g. 
coap:// or http:// GET from ../SmartObject/Resource?spec
invokes the method SmartObject.Resource.get(spec)

An example URI-Path mapping for a PropertyOfInterest would be 
GET ..SmartRoom/Temperature which would be the default mapping for 
SmartRoom.Temperature.SensorValue.get()

In addition, resource mapping can use the semantic tags from the Description 
class instances to route SmartObject Resources. In cases where both 
URI-Path mapping and semantic mapping are used, the semantic mapping 
should follow the URI-Path mapping convention.
