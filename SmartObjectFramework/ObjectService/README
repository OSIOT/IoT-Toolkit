ObjectService Base Classes

ObjectService is a SmartObject instance which is used to store a 
Description for the service and a number of SmartObject instances

GatewayObjectService is an ObjectService with two service interfaces, for example 
one interface for a constrained network e.g. a sensor net using CoAP, and 
another interface for the internet using http.

The interface classes add URL-resource mapping, and content-type negotiation 
and generation by invoking parse and serialize methods from the specific 
resource classes.
